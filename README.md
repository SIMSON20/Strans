# Strans
Any* to any to language voice translator built in python powered by google translator and google text-to-speech API

IMPORTANT NOTE: To get this program working, after installing gTTS library for python replace FILE: Lib/site-packages/gtts_token/gtts_token.py with gtts_token.py given in this repo. This thing should be done because there is a problem in tokenizer of gTTS library and it is not fixed by developer yet. So, this is an un-official fix for that. ;)

*NOTE: Languages which are supported by google translator can only be detected and translated by this program.
